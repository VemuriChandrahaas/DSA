aim:
To implement all operations of a doubly linked list including:
Insertion at beginning
Insertion at a specific position
Insertion at end
Deletion at beginning
Deletion by value
Deletion at a specific position
Deletion from end
searching for a value
Forward and backward display

output:
--- Doubly Linked List Menu ---
1. Add at Beginning
2. Add at Position
3. Add at End
4. Delete from Beginning
5. Delete by Value
6. Delete from Position
7. Delete from End
8. Search
9. Display
10. Exit

Enter value: 10
10 has been added at the beginning.

Enter value: 20
20 has been added at the end.

Enter value: 15, Position: 2
15 inserted at position 2.

Display:
Forward: 10 15 20
Backward: 20 15 10

result:
The program successfully performs all operations on a doubly 
linked list, including insertion, deletion, search, forward and backward traversal.
